# Agriculture in India - Rainfall Analysis and Frost Prediction

## Overview

Agriculture in India has a significant impact on the economy, contributing to 16.6% of the GDP and employing about 50% of the workforce. This project focuses on analyzing rainfall patterns and predicting frost formation on bridge-ways in Iowa, addressing crucial challenges in the agricultural sector.

## Objectives

- Analyze long-term average Indian summer monsoon rainfall using Tableau.
- Explore the potential of Principal Component Analysis for rainfall forecasting.
- Address the challenging problem of predicting frost formation on bridge-ways in Iowa.

## Methodology

### Rainfall Analysis

The project leverages Tableau for rainfall analysis, considering various meteorological and geographical factors. Principal Component Analysis is applied to identify fundamental climate variability modes.

### Frost Prediction

Accurate prediction of frost formation on bridge-ways is crucial for public safety. The project aims to develop predictive models by considering factors such as surface temperature and air moisture.
